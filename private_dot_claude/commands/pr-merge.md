description: Squash merge PR and clean up local branch
---

Let's squash merge the PR using `gh`, admin privileges, and a useful commit message.

After the merge, locally:
1. Check the branch name.
2. Switch to the main branch if we're not already on it.
3. Pull.
4. Delete the local branch that was used for the PR.
