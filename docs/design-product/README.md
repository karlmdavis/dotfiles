# Product Design Documents

Product design specifications for Happy Focus features and capabilities.

## Purpose

Product design documents define **what** to build and **why**, focusing on:
- User problems and needs being addressed.
- Feature specifications and user-facing capabilities.
- Business value and product goals.
- Success metrics from user and business perspective.
- User workflows and experience design.

These documents focus on the product vision and requirements, while engineering design documents
  (`docs/design-engineering/`) focus on technical implementation approaches.

## Naming Convention

See [../README.md](../README.md) for file naming conventions and document structure guidelines.
