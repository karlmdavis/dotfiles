The dotfiles of Karl M. Davis
=============================

This repo contains my dotfiles: the configuration/settings files used on the systems I login to.

I manage these files using [RCM](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm), via the [karlmdavis.rcm](https://github.com/karlmdavis/rcm-ansible-role) Ansible role. To push out the files in this repo to your home directory as dotfiles, simply run:

    $ rcup
